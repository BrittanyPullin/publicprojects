![It's me](https://drive.google.com//1L4gpYc6EXMSqoODbo6rExLouCo2hNYsv)

On this page, I am documenting what my goals and aspriations are for the upcoming new year. I have learned that by documenting and recording these types of things, I am able to keep myself more accountable. 

My hope is to accomplish most of these at the turn of the year but that isn't a hard deadline. 

## Goal 1: Learn Programming Languages

I am hoping to learn a few useful programming languages for both my personal and professional use. 

 Here are some of the languages I'd like to learn. 
  * Python
  * SQL
  * HTML
  * Markdown (complete!) 

Here are some of the reasons I'd like to learn programming:
  * It is an interest of mine
  * I would love to be able to create and build things using programming.
  * I would like to be more technical and be able to use programming for data analysis in my professional career.
  * It is an _**AWESOME**_ skill to know! 
 
  
## Goal 2: Shift into an Operational or Data Analysis Role at Salesforce

As I gain more experience through being a Success Guide, I am hoping to grow my skills and be able to shift into a role that is more operationally driven and/or deals with analyzing data. 

 Here are some of the teams that I am interested in joining:
   1. TMP Team
   2. CSG Operations
   3. Tableau Team
   4. GDO Systems and Tools

Additionally, here are some roles that I think are really cool! 
* [Sr. Product Manager](https://www.myworkday.com/salesforce/d/inst/15$158872/9925$222126.htmld)
* [Program Manager, CSG Operations](https://www.myworkday.com/salesforce/d/inst/15$392530/9925$228613.htmld)


## Goal 3: TBD
